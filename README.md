# Walmart Retail Sales Analysis & Optimization  

## Objective  
This project aims to analyze Walmart’s retail sales across various stores, holidays, fuel prices, unemployment rates, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
We want to discover insights and suggest strategies for sales growth and improvement.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- *Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)* – Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis  
- *SQL* – Data aggregation and query optimization  
- *Power BI* – Dashboard design and interactive insights  
- *Excel* – Initial exploration 

## Key Analyses Performed  
- Comparison of holiday and non-holiday sales  
- Sales by store type and a look at top and bottom performing stores  
- The impact of fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment rates on sales  
- Year-over-year sales growth trends  
- Correlation of macro factors with sales performance  

## Business Insights  
- Non-holiday weeks recorded about 11% higher sales than holiday weeks.  
- Store 20 was the highest-performing store, contributing 4.5% of total sales.  
- The year 2011 had the highest sales compared to all the years analyzed.  
- A CPI of 3.1 showed the strongest correlation with peak sales.  
- Fuel prices and unemployment rates had a negative impact on sales.  

## Action Plan  
- Boost holiday sales by launching targeted promotions and bundled offers.  
- Address fuel price sensitivity by optimizing the supply chain and store-level discounts.  
- Support low-performing stores with regional campaigns for store-level optimization.  
- Plan for seasonality by stocking high-demand items ahead of peak CPI periods.
